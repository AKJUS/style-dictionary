'style-dictionary': minor

Introduce a new entrypoint: `style-dictionary/enums` for most of the library's hard-coded string values. Most of these are built-in hooks names. This provides better type-safety for consumers as well as various maintainability related benefits for this library. [See documentation for more info](https://styledictionary.com/reference/enums).
